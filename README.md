# Redis-using-C++


Welcome to the Redis-like Database Application Repository! This README will guide you through the setup, usage, and structure of the application. The project is implemented in C++ and includes features such as socket programming for TCP connections, an AVL tree for sorted sets, and a hashtable for data storage and retrieval.

# Project Overview
This project is a simplified version of a Redis-like database, implemented in C++. It supports basic Redis operations, including data storage and retrieval, sorted sets using AVL trees, and TCP connections for client-server communication.

# Features
Data Storage and Retrieval: Efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.
Sorted Sets: Implemented using AVL trees for quick access and sorting.
TCP Connection: Supports client-server communication via socket programming.
Command Handling: Basic commands such as GET, SET, DEL, and ZADD.

Socket Programming (for TCP connections)
AVL Tree (for sorted sets)
Hashtable (for data storage and retrieval)
